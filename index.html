            <p><strong>Satyajit Ray;</strong> (2 May 1921 – 23 April 1992) was an Indian film director, screenwriter, 
                author, lyricist, magazine editor, illustrator, calligrapher, and composer. 
                Ray is widely considered one of the greatest and most influential film directors in the history 
                of cinema. He is celebrated for works including The Apu Trilogy (1955–1959),
                The Music Room (1958), The Big City (1963), Charulata (1964), and the Goopy–Bagha trilogy (1969–1992).</p>

            <p> Ray was born in Calcutta to author Sukumar Ray and Suprabha Ray. Starting his career as a commercial artist, 
                Ray was drawn into independent film-making after meeting French filmmaker 
                Jean Renoir and viewing Vittorio De Sica's Italian neorealist 
                film Bicycle Thieves (1948) during a visit to London. Ray grew up in the house of his grandfather, Upendrakishore 
                Ray Chowdhury, and of his printing press. He was attracted by the machines and process of printing from an early age
                and took particular interest in the production process of Sandesh, a children's magazine started by Upendrakishore.
                Ray studied at Ballygunge Government High School in Calcutta, and completed his BA in economics at Presidency College, 
                Calcutta (then affiliated with the University of Calcutta). During his school days, he saw a number of Hollywood productions in cinema. 
                The works of Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, and Ernst Lubitsch and movies such as The Thief of Baghdad (1924) and Uncle Tom's 
                Cabin (1927) made lasting impression on his mind. He also liked Western classical music.

            <p>Satyajit Ray's filmmaking journey began with Pather Panchali (1955), an adaptation of a Bengali novel. Despite financial struggles, Ray shot the film over 2.5 years with an inexperienced crew. The film, completed with a government loan, gained critical acclaim and launched Ray's international career. His next film, Aparajito (1956), won the Golden Lion at Venice, and he completed The Apu Trilogy with Apur Sansar (1959), introducing Soumitra Chatterjee and Sharmila Tagore.
                Ray expanded his work with films like Jalsaghar (1958), Devi (1960), 
                and Charulata (1964), often exploring social themes. His 1961 documentary on Rabindranath Tagore and his revival of Sandesh magazine showcased his literary contributions. Moving into color filmmaking, he directed Kanchenjungha (1962).
                In the late 1960s, Ray experimented with various genres. He planned a
                sci-fi film, The Alien, but Hollywood disputes stalled it. His musical f
                antasy Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne (1969) became a commercial success. Aranyer 
                Din Ratri (1970) examined middle-class escapism. His films gained global 
                recognition, praised for emotional depth, storytelling, and social insight.</p>
